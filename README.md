## Disclaimer


The initial intention behind the creation of the **RecipeNE** is solely for personal interest and to practice my coding skills. This website will not seek any form of profit. The recipes provided on the website are sourced from YouTube creators. We provide the original authors' names, channel links, and original video links for the recipes on the website.


## Intension and background


As a born and raised Northeasterner from Harbin, China, I have always taken pride in the cuisine of our hometown. However, I've noticed that Northeastern Chinese cuisine is not as widely recognized in the United States as some other famous Chinese cuisines, such as Sichuan cuisine. Therefore, I have decided to create a website to promote Chinese Northeastern cuisine. At the same time, I also hope that by developing this website, I can enhance my coding skills and learn new technologies and coding techniques.
